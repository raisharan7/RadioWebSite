				<div>
				<p>In 1971, a California Highway Patrol officer and veteran of the Navy signal corps, who happened to be a ham, came into possession of a little radio emporium on a wooden train platform in Burlingame, CA. Bob Ferrero (Bob), who was then K6AHV and later became W6RJ, was a dedicated California Highway Patrolman. He loved ham radio and was determined to make a go of starting a business selling amateur radio products. 

			Today, Sharan's Radio is a family owned business with 25 sales locations throughout Canada and United States which include a formidable presence on the Internet, making it pone of the largest radio dealership in the world. 

			Sharan's Radio is continually expanding with our newest location in London, ON which opened on November 01, 2018.
